# 🔍 Debugging Interrupt Chain

## Problem
Top is still running after Ctrl+C - need to debug the entire interrupt chain.

## Debug Output Added

### 1. Key Event Detection
Look for these messages in Xcode console when pressing keys:
```
🔍 keyDown: keyCode=8, chars='c', modifiers=...
🎯 Ctrl+C detected in keyDown - CALLING handleInterrupt()
```
OR:
```
🔍 doCommandBy: cancelOperation(_:)
🎯 Ctrl+C detected in doCommandBy (cancelOperation) - CALLING handleInterrupt()
```

### 2. Interrupt Function Entry
Should see:
```
🚨 interruptCurrentCommand() CALLED!
💀 About to nuclear kill PID [number]
```

### 3. Process Termination
Should see terminal output:
```
🚨 FORCE KILLING process [PID]...
💀 Killed all 'top' processes
💀 Process terminated with SIGKILL
```

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Run top and watch console
1. Build and run the app
2. Open Xcode console (View → Debug Area → Activate Console)
3. In terminal, run: `top`
4. Watch console for: `Started process PID [number] (using direct termination)`

### Step 2: Press Ctrl+C and watch for debug output
Press Ctrl+C and look for this sequence:

**Expected Flow:**
1. Key detection: `🔍 keyDown:` OR `🔍 doCommandBy:`
2. Handler called: `🚨 interruptCurrentCommand() CALLED!`
3. Process killing: `💀 About to nuclear kill PID`
4. Terminal output: `🚨 FORCE KILLING process`

### Step 3: Identify where the chain breaks

**If you DON'T see key detection:**
- The terminal view isn't receiving key events
- Focus issue or responder chain problem

**If you see key detection but NOT handler called:**
- handleInterrupt() not being triggered
- Method call issue

**If you see handler called but NO process killing:**
- currentTask is null or not running
- Logic issue in interrupt function

**If you see all debug but top still runs:**
- SIGKILL not working (very rare)
- Process recreation issue

## Quick Test Commands

In Xcode console, you can also run:
```bash
# Check if top is actually running
ps aux | grep top

# Check the specific PID
ps -p [PID_NUMBER]
```

Run these BEFORE and AFTER pressing Ctrl+C to verify if the process actually dies.

## Expected Results

**Working scenario:**
- Key events detected
- Interrupt function called
- Nuclear termination executed
- Top process disappears from ps
- New terminal prompt appears

**Broken scenario will show:**
- Missing debug messages at some step
- Top process still in ps output
- No new terminal prompt
